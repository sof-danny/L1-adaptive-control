# L1-adaptive-control
L1 adaptive control of a tractor cart system using Matlab 

The L1 adaptive control is one of the interesting control methods that might replace MRAC at some point. The analysis in this experiemnent shows that L1 is more robust and adapt quickly compared to MRAC. 

This is a tractor-trailer system, which aims to get a tractor and a trailer to both follow the same path to avoid running over crops. The model incorporates control of the front wheels of the tractor and the wheels of the trailer, as well as disturbances to account for the slope of the terrain or slipping.<img width="1530" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77319818/147987076-3d8a963e-f0c0-4663-b868-8b12a00d8a48.png">
