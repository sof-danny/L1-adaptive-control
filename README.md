L1 adaptive control of a tractor cart system using Matlab 


This is a tractor-trailer system, which aims to get a tractor and a trailer to both follow the same path to avoid running over crops. The model incorporates control of the front wheels of the tractor and the wheels of the trailer, as well as disturbances to account for the slope of the terrain or slipping.<img width="1530" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77319818/147987076-3d8a963e-f0c0-4663-b868-8b12a00d8a48.png">
